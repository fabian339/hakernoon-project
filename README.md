  Hacker Noon - Project
  <br>
</h1>

  This Hacker Noon project was supposed to be a simple post layout similar to[Hacker Noon Official Site](https://hackernoon.com/). As a developer, I really liked the format, layout, and style used at the [Hacker Noon Site](https://hackernoon.com/), and so I decided to implement sort of a duplication of their site.

  As you can see, this layout looks really similar to the [Hacker Noon Site](https://hackernoon.com/). I used React and React Router to allow navigation between routes. I duplicated the post component as I only had one post object. The object was added to a JSON file, to then gather the data and then on click move to the ViewPost route. I also use functional and class-based components as well as React component object style and CSS.

## Description

Having a layout to illustrate the post to users.

  This layout is similar to the one used on the [Hacker Noon Site](https://hackernoon.com/), however, it is not the same. I tried to implement a Grid system provided by Material UI. The [Hacker Noon Site](https://hackernoon.com/) use a 3 column row Grid system in always all pages.


## Error Handler

  This page will not show in the url as is part of surge.sh testing platform. But, I implemented an error checking that will basically check if the post actually exists in the JSON file. I used the "slug" to be the parameter on the url as it is the way used by Hacker Noon.

## Challenges
This project was really fun to work on, however, I really did not have the time to put my all into it. Because of work, I have very limited free time and this was my main challenge as I really wanted to do more. As you can see, the project works on desktop and laptops, but really looks bad on mobile devices. I did not have the proper time to make it mobile compatible. 

Thank you for reading if you got this far!
